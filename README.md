# Accelerating CI 

Accelerating CI has dramatic effects: tightening the feedback loop for developers, delivering changes to production faster, and reducing CI resources costs.

In this talk, we'll see different patterns to optimize CI:

- Collecting key metrics to detect regressions, pinpoint bottlenecks, and confirm improvements

- Setting up an efficient pipeline structure

- Establishing environmental build agent patterns

- Leveraging caches to avoid unnecessary build work

Most of the talk will be based on our experience while developing Gradle Enterprise in a highly productive team of fifteen people.
